# Chapter 4: Comments
- Explain yourself in code
  - Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you’ve made, spend it cleaning that mess.
- Give up mandated comments
  - It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every function and variable must have a comment. Comments like this just clutter up the code.
- Avoid closing brace comments
  - If you find yourself wanting to mark your closing braces, try to shorten your functions instead.
  - e.g. // end of for, or // end of while
- Avoid Water is Wet/redundant comments
  - If you are only restating the obvious, the comment isn't needed and you've successfully expressed yourself via code.
- Do not mandate comments to describe methods.
- Avoid position markers
  - There are rare times when they make sense, but in general they are clutter that should be eliminated.
- Don't give too much information
  - Don’t put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into your comments. That is wat Git/Version control is for.
- Don’t offer systemwide information
  - If you must write a comment, then make sure it describes the code it appears near. Keep it local to where the comment is.
- Avoid attribution and Journal Comments
